    abstract={Do-calculus is concerned with estimating the interventional distribution of an action from the observed joint probability distribution of the variables in a given causal structure. All identifiable causal effects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the effect in question is identifiable or not. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities, and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution, or fails to identify the effect, in which case the effect is non-identifiable. In this paper, the R package causaleffect is presented, which provides an implementation of this algorithm. Functionality of causaleffect is also demonstrated through examples.},

    abstract = {Abstract Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models—also called Bayesian networks—are widely used in probabilistic reasoning, machine learning and causal inference. If latent variables are present, then the set of possible marginal distributions over the remaining (observed) variables is generally not represented by any DAG. Larger classes of mixed graphical models have been introduced to overcome this; however, as we show, these classes are not sufficiently rich to capture all the marginal models that can arise. We introduce a new class of hyper-graphs, called mDAGs, and a latent projection operation to obtain an mDAG from the margin of a DAG. We show that each distinct marginal of a DAG model is represented by at least one mDAG and provide graphical results towards characterizing equivalence of these models. Finally, we show that mDAGs correctly capture the marginal structure of causally interpreted DAGs under interventions on the observed variables.},

    abstract = {Ancestral graph models, introduced by Richardson and Spirtes (2002), generalize both Markov random fields and Bayesian networks to a class of graphs with a global Markov property that is closed under conditioning and marginalization. By design, ancestral graphs encode precisely the conditional independence structures that can arise from Bayesian networks with selection and unobserved (hidden/latent) variables. Thus, ancestral graph models provide a potentially very useful framework for exploratory model selection when unobserved variables might be involved in the data-generating process but no particular hidden structure can be specified. In this paper, we present the Iterative Conditional Fitting (ICF) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian ancestral graph models. The name reflects that in each step of the procedure a conditional distribution is estimated, subject to constraints, while a marginal distribution is held fixed. This approach is in duality to the well-known Iterative Proportional Fitting algorithm, in which marginal distributions are fitted while conditional distributions are held fixed.},

abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;The process of transporting and synthesizing experimental findings from heterogeneous data collections to construct causal explanations is arguably one of the most central and challenging problems in modern data science. This problem has been studied in the causal inference literature under the rubric of causal effect identifiability and transportability (Bareinboim and Pearl 2016). In this paper, we investigate a general version of this challenge where the goal is to learn conditional causal effects from an arbitrary combination of datasets collected under different conditions, observational or experimental, and from heterogeneous populations. Specifically, we introduce a unified graphical criterion that characterizes the conditions under which conditional causal effects can be uniquely determined from the disparate data collections. We further develop an efficient, sound, and complete algorithm that outputs an expression for the conditional effect whenever it exists, which synthesizes the available causal knowledge and empirical evidence; if the algorithm is unable to find a formula, then such synthesis is provably impossible, unless further parametric assumptions are made. Finally, we prove that do-calculus (Pearl 1995) is complete for this task, i.e., the inexistence of a do-calculus derivation implies the impossibility of constructing the targeted causal explanation.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract = 	 {Generalizing causal knowledge across environments is a common challenge shared across many of the data-driven disciplines, including AI and ML. Experiments are usually performed in one environment (e.g., in a lab, on Earth, in a training ground), almost invariably, with the intent of being used elsewhere (e.g., outside the lab, on Mars, in the real world), in an environment that is related but somewhat different than the original one, where certain conditions and mechanisms are likely to change. This generalization task has been studied in the causal inference literature under the rubric of transportability (Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011). While most transportability works focused on generalizing associational and interventional distributions, the generalization of counterfactual distributions has not been formally studied. In this paper, we investigate the transportability of counterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions coming from disparate domains. Specifically, we introduce a sufficient and necessary graphical condition and develop an efficient, sound, and complete algorithm for transporting counterfactual quantities across domains in nonparametric settings. Failure of the algorithm implies the impossibility of generalizing the target counterfactual from the available data without further assumptions.}

    abstract = "{Estimating causal queries, such as changes in protein abundance in response to a perturbation, is a fundamental task in the analysis of biomolecular pathways. The estimation requires experimental measurements on the pathway components. However, in practice many pathway components are left unobserved (latent) because they are either unknown, or difficult to measure. Latent variable models (LVMs) are well-suited for such estimation. Unfortunately, LVM-based estimation of causal queries can be inaccurate when parameters of the latent variables are not uniquely identified, or when the number of latent variables is misspecified. This has limited the use of LVMs for causal inference in biomolecular pathways.In this article, we propose a general and practical approach for LVM-based estimation of causal queries. We prove that, despite the challenges above, LVM-based estimators of causal queries are accurate if the queries are identifiable according to Pearl’s do-calculus and describe an algorithm for its estimation. We illustrate the breadth and the practical utility of this approach for estimating causal queries in four synthetic and two experimental case studies, where structures of biomolecular pathways challenge the existing methods for causal query estimation.The code and the data documenting all the case studies are available at https://github.com/srtaheri/LVMwithDoCalculus.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Causal query estimation in biomolecular networks commonly selects a ‘valid adjustment set’, i.e. a subset of network variables that eliminates the bias of the estimator. A same query may have multiple valid adjustment sets, each with a different variance. When networks are partially observed, current methods use graph-based criteria to find an adjustment set that minimizes asymptotic variance. Unfortunately, many models that share the same graph topology, and therefore same functional dependencies, may differ in the processes that generate the observational data. In these cases, the topology-based criteria fail to distinguish the variances of the adjustment sets. This deficiency can lead to sub-optimal adjustment sets, and to miss-characterization of the effect of the intervention. We propose an approach for deriving ‘optimal adjustment sets’ that takes into account the nature of the data, bias and finite-sample variance of the estimator, and cost. It empirically learns the data generating processes from historical experimental data, and characterizes the properties of the estimators by simulation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in four biomolecular Case studies with different topologies and different data generation processes.

 abstract={Causal effect identification considers whether an interventional probability distribution can be uniquely determined without parametric assumptions from measured source distributions and structural knowledge on the generating system. While complete graphical criteria and procedures exist for many identification problems, there are still challenging but important extensions that have not been considered in the literature such as combined transportability and selection bias, or multiple sources of selection bias. To tackle these new settings, we present a search algorithm directly over the rules of do-calculus. Due to the generality of do-calculus, the search is capable of taking more advanced datagenerating mechanisms into account along with an arbitrary type of both observational and experimental source distributions. The search is enhanced via a heuristic and search space reduction techniques. The approach, called do-search, is provably sound, and it is complete with respect to identifiability problems that have been shown to be completely characterized by do-calculus. When extended with additional rules, the search is capable of handling missing data problems as well. With the versatile search, we are able to approach new problems for which no other algorithmic solutions exist. We perform a systematic analysis of bivariate missing data problems and study causal inference under case-control design. We also present the R package dosearch that provides an interface for a C++ implementation of the search.},
