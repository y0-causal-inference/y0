## Authorship Concept

- All material contributors to the Y0 package are eligible for authorship.
- Lead authorship will be shared between Charles Tapley Hoyt and Jeremy Zucker
- Remaining authors will be listed alphabetically by last name
- JOSS's [authorship policy](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#authorship) states:

  > Purely financial (such as being named on an award) and organizational (such as general supervision of a research
  > group) contributions are not considered sufficient for co-authorship of JOSS submissions, but active project
  > direction and other forms of non-code contributions are.

## Extras

Some references that didn't make it into the manuscript:

- Good and bad controls [@cinelli2022crash] (could go in future work)
