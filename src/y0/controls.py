    > At first look, Model 13 might seem similar to Model 12, and one may think that
    adjusting for Z would bias the effect estimate, by restricting variations of th
    mediator M. However, the key difference here is that Z is a cause, not an effect,
    of the mediator (and, consequently, also a cause of Y ). Thus, Model 13 is analogous
    to Model 8, and so controlling for Z will be neutral in terms of bias and may increase
    the precision of the ACE estimate in finite samples. Readers can find further
    discussion of this case in Pearl (2013).

    From Jeremy:
    Figure 9: Model 13: If exists M such that X is Ancestor of M and M is
    ancestor of Y and Z is an ancestor of M and Z _|_ Y | M  and Z _|_ X

    Strategy:

    1. First implement the helper function below:
        1. Use :func:`y0.algorithm.conditional_independencies.are_d_separated` with the ``given`` argument
           to check Z _|_ Y | M
        2. Use :func:`y0.algorithm.conditional_independencies.are_d_separated` to check Z _|_ X
        3. Magic
        4. Small profit
    2. Check if the helper returns true for any possible mediator M (loop over all variables, naive implementation ftw)
    3. Big Profit
