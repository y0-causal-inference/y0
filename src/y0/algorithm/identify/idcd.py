IDCD Algorith Implementation (Algorith 1, Lines 13-28) from Forré & Mooij (2019).

This module implements the IDCD (IDentification within Consolidated Districts) algorithm,
which is a helper function for the main cyclic ID algorithm. IDCD handles identification
of causal effects within consolidated districts of directed mixed graphs that may contain
