    r"""Implement the first half of Line 3 of the SIMPLIFY algorithm from [correa22a]_.

    The implementation is as simple as creating a dictionary. Adding variables to
    the dictionary removes repeated variables in the input event, and adding values to
    the dictionary using the variables as keys removes repeated values.

    :math: **if** there exists $Y_{\mathbf{x}}\in \mathbf{Y}_\ast$ with
    two consistent values in  $\mathbf{y_\ast} \cap Y_x$ **then**
    remove repeated variables from $\mathbf{Y_\ast}$ and values $\mathbf{y_\ast}$.

    In this function we also handle a case that [correa22a]_ does not address. Some variables
    passed in to Algorithm 2 of [correa22a]_ (transport_unconditional_counterfactual_query())
    from Algorithm 3 of [correa22a]_ (transport_conditional_counterfactual_query())
    may have values of None, because they were ancestors of a counterfactual when processed
    in Algorithm 3 and not variables passed in to Algorithm 3 along with actual values.
    Such variables may be redundant with variables passed in to Algorithm 2 for which values
    are observed. Because a value of None in this context implies that the variable could
    take any value, it is consistent with a specific value. Its intervention set is also
    guaranteed to match the intervention set of its counterpart that has a specific value, because
    all variables passed from Algorithm 3 to Algorithm 2 are in counterfactual factor form.
    Therefore, in this function, we want to treat the None value as consistent with a specific value.
