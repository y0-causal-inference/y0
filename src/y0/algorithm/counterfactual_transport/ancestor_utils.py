    # works: a variable is either its own base in which we're done, or it's not in which case this
    # one-line function returns its base.) A and B definitely get compared during the for loop that
    # calls combinations_with_replacement() on input_sets, at which point B goes into the adjaceny
    # list for A and A goes into the adjacency list for B. Next, observe that every vertex V gets
    # visited at least once by dft(), either by a call to dft(V,V) or recursively, by a call to
    # dft(V, W) where W is some other node with V as its neighbor. So, one of three things can happen:
    # 1. A gets visited for the first time with a call dft(A,A), in which case dft(A,A) adds
    #    A to components[A]. The final line will then union sets A and B together as B is a
    #    neighbor of A.
    # 2. B gets visited for the first time with a call dft(B,B), in which case dft(B,B) adds
    #    B to components[B]. The final line will then union sets A and B together as A is a
    #    neighbor of B.
    # 3. A gets visited for the first time with a call dft(A,C), at which point A goes into
    #    components[C]. During the last line of this function, A and its neighbors will
    #    then get unioned together, so A and B will go into one set.
    #    a. If B hasn't been visited, then dft(B, C) gets called, at which point B goes into
    #       components[C]. Then A, B, and C will get merged during the last line of this function
    #       because A and B will be neighbors of C.
    #    b. B cannot have already been visited. Assume it was visited already. It could have been per
    #       a call dft(B,B) which would lead to a call dft(A,B) since A hasn't been visited.
    #       But we visited A for the first time with a call dft(A,C), a contradiction. It could have
    #       been per a call dft(B,C) in which case B is also a neighbor of C, and A, B, and C will get
    #       merged during the last line of this function. Or it could have been per a call dft(B,D)
    #       where D is some other vertex. But since dft is a depth-first traversal, a call
    #       dft(B,D) would have led to a call dft(A,D) and A was visited for the first time
    #       in the call dft(A,C). So all three possibilities lead to contradictions and B cannot
    #       have already been visited.

    #    We have seen that in all possible cases, _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() leads

    # of merged_ancestral_outcomes.
    # Then, either _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() returned two frozen sets with a vertex
    # in common or it didn't, and _merge_frozen_sets_linked_by_bidirectional_edges() therefore
    # split a frozen set.  _merge_frozen_sets_linked_by_bidirectional_edges() only ever applies
    # union operations to input sets, so the latter condition could not have happened. That leaves
    # _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() returning two frozen sets with a vertex in common.
    # Again, it only applies union operations to input sets, so there must have existed two input sets
    # with a vertex in common that didn't get merged.
    # So _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() returned two frozen sets with a vertex in common.

    # Consider two such sets, A and B, that both contain vertex V (or equivalently, which contain two
    # counterfactual variables with base variable V). (_convert_counterfactual_variables_to_base_variables()
    # works: a variable is either its own base in which we're done, or it's not in which case this
    # one-line function returns its base.) A and B definitely get compared during the for loop that
    # calls combinations_with_replacement() on input_sets, at which point B goes into the adjaceny
    # list for A and A goes into the adjacency list for B. Next, observe that every vertex V gets
    # visited at least once by dft(), either by a call to dft(V,V) or recursively, by a call to
    # dft(V, W) where W is some other node with V as its neighbor. So, one of three things can happen:
    # 1. A gets visited for the first time with a call dft(A,A), in which case dft(A,A) adds
    #    A to components[A]. The final line will then union sets A and B together as B is a
    #    neighbor of A.
    # 2. B gets visited for the first time with a call dft(B,B), in which case dft(B,B) adds
    #    B to components[B]. The final line will then union sets A and B together as A is a
    #    neighbor of B.
    # 3. A gets visited for the first time with a call dft(A,C), at which point A goes into
    #    components[C]. During the last line of this function, A and its neighbors will
    #    then get unioned together, so A and B will go into one set.
    #    a. If B hasn't been visited, then dft(B, C) gets called, at which point B goes into
    #       components[C]. Then A, B, and C will get merged during the last line of this function
    #       because A and B will be neighbors of C.
    #    b. B cannot have already been visited. Assume it was visited already. It could have been per
    #       a call dft(B,B) which would lead to a call dft(A,B) since A hasn't been visited.
    #       But we visited A for the first time with a call dft(A,C), a contradiction. It could have
    #       been per a call dft(B,C) in which case B is also a neighbor of C, and A, B, and C will get
    #       merged during the last line of this function. Or it could have been per a call dft(B,D)
    #       where D is some other vertex. But since dft is a depth-first traversal, a call
    #       dft(B,D) would have led to a call dft(A,D) and A was visited for the first time
    #       in the call dft(A,C). So all three possibilities lead to contradictions and B cannot
    #       have already been visited.
    # We have seen that in all possible cases, _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() leads
    # to A and B merged into a frozen set. So we must reject our assumption that there's a vertex in
    # more than one component of merged_ancestral_outcomes, and this validity check is unnecessary
    # and the line of code will never be run.

    # The adjacency lists for both A and B get visited during
    # the loop through the adj_list dictionary. If A and B get placed into the same connected component
    # during this step, then they get merged during the union operation during the last line, at which point
    # _merge_frozen_sets_with_common_vertices() does not

    # We wish to show that A and B will get placed
    # into a connected component.
    #
    # One of three things can happen:

    # 3. Note that if A and B are to be ultimately merged, they must be part of a connected
    #
    # B gets visited for the first time with a call dft(B,B) and then calls dft(A,B) within
    # When that happens, either A has been visited before during a
    # call to dft() or it has not. If it has not, then dft(A,A) gets called,
