Assuming that a program to provide ARTs to the public would only work if people are willing to take the drugs, suppose we want to know what receiving ARTs ($t_0$) does to AIDS-related mortality in a target population $\\pi^\\ast$, but specifically for people who choose to receive generic ARTs. So, we care about the difference in mortality for a person who chooses to take ARTs, compared to those for a person required to take them. Thus, we wish to know $E[A_{t_0} | t_0] - E[A_t | t_0]$. The first quantity is $E[A | t_0] = \\frac{E[A, t_0]}{E[t_0]}$, and the second is $E[A_t | t_0] = \\frac{E[A_t, t_0]}{E[t_0]}$. Let's estimate $E[A_t, t_0]$ using `transport_unconditional_counterfactual_query()`, introducing our data sets first."

    "Recent years have seen an increase in heat domes in North America and other extremes in hot and cold weather. One theory for their increase in frequency is that as the temperature of the earth rises and the polar ice caps melt the temperature differential between the poles and the equator drops, leading to a slowing-down of the jet stream that causes it to meander like a river does on a shallow grade compared to a steep slope. That in turn can create \"heat domes\" during the summer -- places where the jet stream deviates to the north, along with associated fires and droughts. It can also create copious amounts of snowfall and frigid winters elsewhere for the same reason. Let's consider a scenario in which the United States, concerned about heat domes and their effects on reservoir levels in the future, is considering imposing a carbon tax in order to both directly affect temperatures and also subsidize cities such as New York to conduct cloud seeding to keep reservoirs filled during emergencies. A graph might look like the following:"
