    "#### 1.1 Why do we need an algorithm for Cyclic Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional causal inference methods assume **acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, which have no feedback loops allowed in them. However, more realistic systems and networks often do include these cycles. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gene regulatory networks (GRNs): Gene X activates gene Y, which activates gene Z, which feeds back to activate gene X again. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Economic systems: Interest rates affect inflation, which affects interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks: Recurrent connections create feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of this **generalized ID** algorithm for input-output Structural Causal Models (ioSCMs) handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cycles (feedback loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Latent confounders (unmeasured causes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arbitrary probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Key Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a directed mixed graph $G$ with cycles, observational data $P(V)$ and a causal query: \"What is $P(Y | \\text{do}(X))$?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question we ask with this algorithm is ***can we identify the causal effect $P(Y | \\text{do}(X))$ from the observational distribution $P(V)$ alone?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The **generalized ID algorithm** answers this question for cyclic graphs. \n"
