    "\n",
    "**High-level strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find relevant variables**: Identify which variables are actually needed (ancestors of our outcome).\n",
    "2. **Break into pieces**: Split the graph into manageable \"districts\", or groups of variables that need to be handled together.\n",
    "3. **Identify each piece**: Use the IDCD algorithm to identify each district separately.\n",
    "4. **Combine results**: Multiply the identified pieces together and focus on our outcome variable.\n",

    "**Why this works for cycles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods assume acyclic graphs (no feedback loops). This algorithm handles cycles by:\n",
    "- Treating feedback loops as unified blocks (consolidated districts)\n",
    "- Using a special ordering (apt-order) instead of topological order\n",
