    "\n",
    "1. **Find relevant variables**: Identify which variables are actually needed (ancestors of our outcome).\n",

    "3. **Identify each piece**: Use the IDCD algorithm to identify each district separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional methods assume acyclic graphs (no feedback loops). This algorithm handles cycles by:\n",
    "- Treating feedback loops as unified blocks (consolidated districts)\n",
    "- Using a special ordering (apt-order) instead of topological order\n",
