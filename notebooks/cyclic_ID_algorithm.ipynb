    "\n",
    "**Precondition 1: Nested Subsets ($C \\subseteq D \\subseteq V$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:**\n",
    "- Target variables $C$ must be inside district $D$\n",
    "- District $D$ must be inside the full variable set $V$\n",
    "- Creates a containment hierarchy: $C$ ⊆ $D$ ⊆ $V$\n",

    "**Precondition 2: Single Consolidated District ($\\text{CD}(G_D) = \\{D\\}$)**\n",

    "- When we look at the induced subgraph $G_D$ (graph restricted to district $D$)\n",
    "- All variables in $D$ form **exactly one** consolidated district\n",
    "- The district cannot be broken into smaller independent pieces\n",

    "- If $D$ could be split into multiple districts, those should be handled separately (in the main loop, Lines 4-9)\n",
