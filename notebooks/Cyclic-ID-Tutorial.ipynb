    "## Why use the Cyclic ID Algorithm? \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional causal inference algorithms like the **ID algorithm** assume graphs are **acyclic** (no feedback loops). However, many real systems contain cycles. For example, in biological systems, **gene regulatory networks** regulate each other which can cause many complex feedback loops and latent confounders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "When cycles are present in a graph, the traditional methods fail because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There's no topological ordering of variables\n",
    "2. Standard conditional independence relationships break down\n",
    "3. Feedback loops create complex dependencies \n",
    "\n",
    "### One Solution: Cyclic ID Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cyclic ID algoritm (Forré & Mooij, 2019) extends causal identification to **input/output Structural Causal Models (ioSCMs)** that can handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directed cycles that form strongly connected components (SCCs).\n",
    "- Latent confounders represented by bidirected edges.\n",
    "- **Consolidated districts** where both cycles and confounders create complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will see how this works with an example graph with genes. "
