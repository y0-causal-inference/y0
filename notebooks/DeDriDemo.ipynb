    "# Axes of Query Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **model transformation complexity** ranging from simple queries over Pearl’s causal hierarchy (association and intervention) to complex queries (multiple world counterfactuals)\n",
    "* **simulation complexity**, ranging from unconditional (forward simulation) queries to conditional queries (inverse problem)\n",
    "* **decision complexity**, ranging from simple decisions (compare A vs B) to sophisticated decisions “optimize f(x) subject to g(x) = 0, h(x) <= 0\n",
    "* **intervention complexity**, In general, interventions that modify Petri nets are guaranteed to generate ODE's that preserve mass balance. Interventions that modify ODEs directly have no such guarantees.  As we explore additional queries in the ASKEM starter kit, we will likely need to represent interventions that directly modify the trajectories of the ODE's, which may result in further assumption violations. \n",
    "* **data complexity**.   Just as \"no plan has survived contact with the enemy\",  it may also be the case that \"no model has survived contact with data\". Unobserved confounding, missing data, and selection bias all threaten the validity of causal effect estimates.  Furthermore, when data come from different populations with different distributions over the same variables, care must be taken to avoid introducing bias.  By specifying queries that acknowledge these threats to validity, we can generate models that take these factors into account and apply formal causal reasoning to recover from the biases these threats may cause.\n",
